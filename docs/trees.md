# **Tree Data Structures in C**

## **Binary Trees**
A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure where each node has at most two children.

- **Node structure**: Each node contains data and pointers to left and right child nodes
- **Tree creation**: Allocating memory for nodes and linking them together in a tree structure
- **Tree traversal**: Methods to visit nodes (preorder, inorder, postorder, level-order)
- **Tree operations**: Inserting, deleting, and modifying nodes
- **Tree properties**: Height, depth, balance factor, completeness, etc.

## **Binary Search Trees**
BSTs are binary trees with ordered nodes - left subtree contains smaller values, right contains larger.

- **BST properties**: Ordered arrangement enabling efficient searching
- **Insertion**: O(log n) operation to add new nodes while maintaining BST property
- **Deletion**: Removing nodes while preserving tree structure and BST property
- **Searching**: Binary search providing O(log n) lookup time
- **Balancing**: Maintaining balanced structure for optimal performance

## **Advanced Tree Types**
Specialized tree structures with unique properties and use cases:

- **AVL trees**: Self-balancing BST where heights of subtrees differ by at most 1
- **Red-black trees**: Self-balancing BST using node coloring for balance
- **B-trees**: Multiway search trees optimized for disk access
- **Tries**: Tree structure for storing strings, useful for prefix matching
- **Heaps**: Complete binary trees satisfying heap property (min/max heaps)

## **Tree Operations**
Common operations performed on tree structures:

- **Height calculation**: Finding maximum depth from root to leaf
- **Node counting**: Determining total number of nodes in tree
- **Tree balancing**: Restructuring to maintain balanced properties
- **Subtree operations**: Working with portions of larger trees
- **Tree comparison**: Checking equality or similarity between trees

## **Applications**
Real-world uses of tree data structures:

- **Expression trees**: Representing and evaluating mathematical expressions
- **Decision trees**: Modeling decisions and consequences in AI/ML
- **File systems**: Organizing files and directories hierarchically
- **Database indexing**: Optimizing data lookup and retrieval
- **Huffman coding**: Data compression using frequency-based tree structure

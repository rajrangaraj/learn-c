# Testing C Programs

## Unit Testing
- Test frameworks: Software tools like Unity, CUnit, or Google Test that provide structure and utilities for writing and running unit tests
- Test cases: Individual tests that verify a specific function or component behaves as expected
- Test suites: Collections of related test cases grouped together for organization and execution
- Assertions: Statements that verify expected conditions and results during test execution
- Mocking: Creating fake objects/functions to isolate the code being tested from external dependencies

## Integration Testing
- Component testing: Testing interactions between different modules or components of the system
- System testing: Testing the complete integrated system as a whole
- Test environments: Dedicated setups that mirror production environments for testing
- Test data: Sample data used to verify system behavior under different scenarios
- Test coverage: Measuring how much of the codebase is exercised by tests

## Test Automation
- Build automation: Automating the compilation and building process using tools like Make
- Test runners: Programs that execute test suites and report results automatically
- Continuous integration: Automatically building and testing code changes when committed
- Test reporting: Generating detailed reports of test execution results and failures
- Regression testing: Re-running tests to ensure new changes haven't broken existing functionality

## Performance Testing
- Benchmarking: Measuring and comparing program performance metrics
- Load testing: Testing system behavior under expected normal load conditions
- Stress testing: Testing system behavior under extreme load conditions
- Memory testing: Checking for memory leaks and proper memory management using tools like Valgrind
- Profiling: Analyzing program performance to identify bottlenecks using tools like gprof

## **Best Practices**
- **Test organization**: Structuring tests logically and maintaining clear test hierarchies
- **Test documentation**: Documenting test purposes, procedures, and expected results
- **Code coverage**: Aiming for comprehensive test coverage of the codebase
- **Test maintenance**: Regularly updating tests to match code changes and removing obsolete tests
- **Test-driven development**: Writing tests before implementing features to guide development

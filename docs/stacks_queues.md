# Stacks and Queues in C
## **Stack Basics**
- **Stack concept**: Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure where elements are added and removed from same end
- **Basic operations**: Push adds elements to top, pop removes from top, peek examines top without removal
- **Stack properties**: Maintains insertion order for retrieval in reverse, useful for nested processing
- **Common uses**: Function call tracking, expression parsing, undo systems, backtracking algorithms
- **Implementation options**: Can be implemented using arrays or linked lists with different tradeoffs

## **Queue Basics**
- **Queue concept**: First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure where elements enter at rear and leave from front
- **Basic operations**: Enqueue adds elements at rear, dequeue removes from front, peek examines front
- **Queue properties**: Maintains insertion order for retrieval, useful for sequential processing
- **Common uses**: Task scheduling, resource management, breadth-first algorithms, buffering
- **Implementation options**: Array-based or linked implementations with different space/time tradeoffs

## Stack Implementation
- Array-based stacks: Implementation using fixed-size arrays where elements are pushed/popped from one end. Simple but has size limitations.
- Linked list stacks: Uses dynamic nodes to store elements, allowing flexible size but requiring more memory per element.
- Push operations: Adds elements to the top of stack in O(1) time. Must check for overflow in array implementation.
- Pop operations: Removes and returns top element in O(1) time. Must check for underflow condition.
- Stack overflow/underflow: Error conditions when pushing to full stack or popping from empty stack. Must be handled gracefully.

## Queue Implementation  
- Array-based queues: Uses fixed array with front and rear pointers. Elements added at rear, removed from front.
- Linked list queues: Dynamic implementation using nodes. Front and rear pointers track ends of queue.
- Enqueue operations: Adds elements to rear of queue in O(1) time. Array implementation must check for full queue.
- Dequeue operations: Removes elements from front in O(1) time. Must check for empty queue condition.
- Circular queues: Efficient array implementation that wraps around to reuse space. Requires careful pointer management.

## Special Types
- Priority queues: Elements have priority values determining dequeue order. Often implemented with heaps.
- Double-ended queues: Allow insertion/deletion at both ends. More flexible but complex implementation.
- Circular queues: Space-efficient array implementation that reuses freed space at start.
- Stack with min/max: Tracks minimum/maximum element in O(1) time using auxiliary stack.
- Queue with history: Maintains record of operations for undo/monitoring. Uses additional memory.

## Applications
- Expression evaluation: Parsing and evaluating mathematical expressions using operator precedence.
- Function calls: Managing program execution stack frames and local variables.
- Undo mechanisms: Tracking operations in applications to enable undo/redo functionality.
- Task scheduling: Managing processes and tasks in operating systems and applications.
- Memory management: Tracking memory allocations and implementing memory pools.

## Advanced Topics
- Thread-safe implementations: Synchronization mechanisms to safely use stacks/queues in concurrent programs.
- Bounded queues: Fixed-size implementations with blocking or overflow handling for producer-consumer scenarios.
- Lock-free structures: Implementation techniques avoiding locks for better concurrent performance.
- Memory efficient designs: Optimizing memory usage through clever data organization and algorithms.
- Performance optimization: Techniques like cache-consciousness and avoiding false sharing in concurrent code.

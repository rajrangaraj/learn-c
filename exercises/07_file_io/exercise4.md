# Exercise 3: CSV Parser

Create a CSV file parser that:
1. Reads a CSV file with headers
2. Parses data into appropriate structures
3. Allows filtering and sorting data
4. Exports filtered data to new CSV
5. Handles malformed data gracefully

Requirements:
- Support quoted fields with commas
- Handle different line endings
- Report parsing errors with line numbers
- Memory-efficient processing

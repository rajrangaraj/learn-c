# Exercise 2: Dynamic Matrix Operations

Create a program that:
1. Allocates two dynamic matrices (size input by user)
2. Fills matrices with random numbers
3. Multiplies the matrices
4. Prints result
5. Frees all memory

Requirements:
- Check for valid matrix multiplication dimensions
- Handle memory allocation failures
- Free memory in correct order
